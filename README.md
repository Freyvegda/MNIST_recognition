# MNIST_recognition
This Program identifies the digits from 0-9.
The digits are handwritten and the neural network is trained and coded with the help of PyTorch. 
They are passed through the neural network.
The neural network identifies the digit and the last cell in the .ipynb is the predicted output.
I have used 3 EPOCHS for better yet fast loss calculations.
Change the X[*your_value] to change the digits in last 2 cells of the .ipynb file.
After a few runs the accuracy obtained is around 96%.
